
Command Shell 208:

+ A list of commands that I (I'm shell208)can execute

- help: print out a help text to help you use this command shell.

- single command with arguments: ls lists all the sub directories under current directory. (you can add arguments for ls like ls -l, or ls -l -a)

- redirecting (write): redirect output from standard output to somefile name you enter as parameter. ls > elk.txt (in redirecting you can also add arguments for your single command: ls -l -a > elk).

- redirecting (read): redirect input from standard input to some file name. for example, wc -l < elk.txt

- piping: direct the output of one process to another process. example, ls | wc -l

- catch signal: handle ^C signal and "exit" user input. The program won't end with ^C, only with "exit"

+ things that I (shell208) can't do:

- multiple pipes.

- different operations at once.
