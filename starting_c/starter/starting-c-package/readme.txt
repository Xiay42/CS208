Starting C
CS208 Intro to Computer Systems
4 January 2023

This is your first starter package for this course. Here's
a very brief description of how to use the Makefile and test data
provided here.

To build your "shoutify" program:
- Write your C program shoutify.c
- Run "make shoutify"
- If your program compiles properly, the executable file
    shoutify will appear

To run the one tiny test of shoutify provided here:
- Run "make test-shoutify"

For "sorter", you can do same things replacing "shoutify"
with "sorter".

For your convenience, just "make" will build and test both
shoutify and sorter.
